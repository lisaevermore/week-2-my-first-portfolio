# week-2-my-first-portfolio
### Portfolio Page
Welcome to the repository for building a portfolio page. This project is designed to help me showcase mine skills and talents. The portfolio should highlight my strongest work and the thought process behind it.

### Why is a portfolio important?
Having a portfolio with deployed web applications is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. This is because it showcases your skills and talents in a tangible way, and demonstrates your ability to create and deploy functional web applications.

### What will I learn?
In this challenge, I will apply the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. By completing this project, I will get to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search.
